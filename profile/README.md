## What is ETHBrno?

**ETHBrno** is an annual independent & open community hackathon (former conference) for supporters of decentralised finance, smart contracts and Web3 happening in Brno, Czech Republic.

ETHBrno events are organized by [Gwei.cz](http://gwei.cz/) community with the help of the [UTXO Foundation](https://utxo.foundation/).


## ETHBrnoÂ²

Lunarpunk hackathon focused on privacy and security. We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right. And good privacy needs good security foundations.
